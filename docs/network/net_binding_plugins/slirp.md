# Slirp

## Overview

[SLIRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slirp) provides user-space
network connectivity.

> **Note:** in `slirp` mode, the only supported protocols are TCP and
> UDP. ICMP is *not* supported.

## Slirp network binding plugin
[v1.1.0]

The binding plugin replaces the [core `slirp` binding](../../network/interfaces_and_networks.md#slirp)
API.

> **Note**: The network binding plugin infrastructure is in Alpha stage.
> Please use them with care.

The slirp binding plugin consists of the following components:

- Sidecar image.

As described in the [definition & flow](../../network/network_binding_plugins.md#definition--flow) section,
the slirp plugin needs to:

- Assure access to the sidecar image.
- Enable the network binding plugin framework FG.
- Register the binding plugin on the Kubevirt CR.
- Reference the network binding by name from the VM spec interface.

> **Note**: In order for the core slirp binding to use the network binding plugin
> the registered name for this binding should be `slirp`.

### Feature Gate
If not already set, add the `NetworkBindingPlugins` FG.
```
kubectl patch kubevirts -n kubevirt kubevirt --type=json -p='[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/configuration/developerConfiguration/featureGates/-",   "value": "NetworkBindingPlugins"}]'
```

> **Note**: The specific slirp plugin has no FG by its own. It is up to the cluster
> admin to decide if the plugin is to be available in the cluster.

### Slirp Registration
As described in the [registration section](../../network/network_binding_plugins.md#register), slirp binding plugin
configuration needs to be added to the kubevirt CR.

To register the slirp binding, patch the kubevirt CR as follows:
```yaml
kubectl patch kubevirts -n kubevirt kubevirt --type=json -p='[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/configuration/network",   "value": {
            "binding": {
                "slirp": {
                    "sidecarImage": "quay.io/kubevirt/network-slirp-binding:v1.1.0"
                }
            }
        }}]'
```

### VM Slirp Network Interface
Set the VM network interface binding name to reference the one defined in the
kubevirt CR.
